\# 🎯 AI Mock Interview Coach (Multi-Agent System)



An AI-powered mock interview system that simulates realistic interviews, evaluates responses, and provides structured coaching feedback.



Built as a multi-agent system using LLMs, this project demonstrates prompt engineering, agent orchestration, and adaptive conversational design.

\## 🏗️ Architecture Overview



The system consists of three distinct agents:



\### 1. Interviewer Agent

\- Conducts the interview

\- Asks questions dynamically

\- Adapts based on previous responses and evaluation signals



\### 2. Evaluator Agent

\- Analyzes each candidate response

\- Outputs structured JSON:

&#x20; - clarity

&#x20; - depth

&#x20; - relevance

&#x20; - confidence

\- Suggests:

&#x20; - follow-up direction

&#x20; - difficulty adjustment



\### 3. Coach Agent

\- Reviews full interview transcript

\- Generates structured feedback:

&#x20; - strengths

&#x20; - weaknesses

&#x20; - missed opportunities

&#x20; - actionable improvements

\## 🔁 Orchestration Flow

User Input → Interviewer starts



Loop (5–7 turns):

Interviewer → asks question

User → answers

Evaluator → evaluates answer

Context updated → influences next question



End:

Coach → generates final feedback
