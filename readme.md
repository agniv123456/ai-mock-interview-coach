\🏗️ Architecture Overview



The system consists of three distinct agents:



\1. Interviewer Agent

\- Conducts the interview

\- Asks questions dynamically

\- Adapts based on previous responses and evaluation signals



\2. Evaluator Agent

\- Analyzes each candidate response

\- Outputs structured JSON:

&#x20; - clarity

&#x20; - depth

&#x20; - relevance

&#x20; - confidence

\- Suggests:

&#x20; - follow-up direction

&#x20; - difficulty adjustment



\3. Coach Agent

\- Reviews full interview transcript

\- Generates structured feedback:

&#x20; - strengths

&#x20; - weaknesses

&#x20; - missed opportunities

&#x20; - actionable improvements

\🔁 Orchestration Flow

User Input → Interviewer starts



Loop (5–7 turns):

Interviewer → asks a question

User → answers

Evaluator → evaluates answer

Context updated → influences next question



End:

Coach → generates final feedback
